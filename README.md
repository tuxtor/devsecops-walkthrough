# DevSecOps Walkthrough

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my current knowledge of the following tools, practices, and architectural principles:

## Architecture Principles
- [12 Factor App: Cloud Native Principles](https://12factor.net/)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Static code analysis during pipelines ([SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) is recommended for Java projects)

## Tools
- OpenTofu (Terraform)
- Java 21
- Quarkus
- AWS
- Docker (used for containerization in Quarkus workloads)

## Additional Practices
- Automated testing with Maven
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- GitHub Actions workflow badges for infra and application
